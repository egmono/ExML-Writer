| ExML Writer translates any DataTable or DataSet object into an Excel-
| readable workbook. It can apply styling to header rows as defined in the 
| configuration file (see attached "Test" project). Multiple DataTables are 
| processed into multiple worksheets and the data is output into columns, 
| as it would look in a database table. The information can then be 
| manipulated as any other Excel spreadsheet.
